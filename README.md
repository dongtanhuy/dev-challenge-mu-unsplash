<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./demo.png)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
  * You can take a look [here](https://sharp-hugle-07825d.netlify.app/) 
- What was your experience?
  * I am trying to apply Typescript a React project. So this is an opportunity for me to learn typescript with React
- What have you learned/improved?
  * I think using typescript takes me more time than using just javascript. However, I think it will help to reduce a lot of potential bugs related to Type checking
